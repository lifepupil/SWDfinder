# UPDATE:
# 1. Now returns the scores for a PSR from each of the 3 phase difference distributions. Valuable for SWC characterization.

# UPDATE (2-28-13):
# 0. phaseWeigh3D v.1.0 (phaseWeigh v.2.0)
# 1. phaseWeigh3D is derived from and improvement over original phaseWeigh function

# UPDATE (5-10-13):
# 1. If there is no phase synchrony in ps12 then it previously wrote 0, however 0 is a valid phase degree, so modified so .ps12 files write -1 if no synch;
#	added conditional in this function to detect when this occurs.

# UPDATE (7-10-13):
# 	Added line to permit either ps12 or pd12 signals to be passed to this function by making sure that values always fall between 0 and 359

# UPDATE (4-1-14):
# - stripped this function down to bare essentials
